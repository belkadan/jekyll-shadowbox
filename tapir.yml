# This file is used with the export_to_tapir.rb script, found under _plugins.
# It is for new users signing up for Tapir who want to use the Tapir's article
# push feature rather than temporarily generating a full newsfeed and waiting
# for Tapir's import to complete. To do this:
#
# Step 1: Remove tapir.yml from _config.yml's excludes.
# Step 2: Generate your site. Make sure this is using your live site's baseurl.
# Step 3: Run the export_to_tapir script as follows:
#	_plugins/export_to_tapir.rb <your_tapir_secret_key> path/to/generated/tapir.yml
# Step 4: Wait. There's a delay of 0.2s per post so that Tapir doesn't think we're DoSing them.
# Step 5: Put tapir.yml back in _config.yml's excludes.
#
# You should only have to do this once, since Tapir watches your newsfeed for any new posts.
#
# Note that this only causes Tapir to index /news/ posts. If you want /everything/
# on your site indexed, not only will you have to change the for-loop below, but
# you'll have to provide another newsfeed that doesn't just show news-posts.
#
# BTW, this YAML section is NOT part of the file content, it's a header for Jekyll!
