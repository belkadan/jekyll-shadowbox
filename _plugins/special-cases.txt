# This file allows you to have control over how tag and category names are
# rendered, using 'case entries'. There are two kinds of case entry:
# 1. A simple entry shows the proper casing for a word or phrase.
# 2. A complex entry provides a substitution, in the form old<TAB>new.
# Each line is a different entry. Both kinds of entry can have spaces.

# Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
